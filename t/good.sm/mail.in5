This is the preamble.  It is to be ignored, though it
is a handy place for composition agents to include an
explanatory note to non-MIME conformant readers.

--simple boundary

This is implicitly typed plain US-ASCII text.
It does NOT end with a linebreak.
--simple boundary
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is explicitly typed plain US-ASCII text.
It DOES end with a linebreak.

--simple boundary--

This is the epilogue.  It is also to be ignored.
